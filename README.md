# 2072

2072 is a simple and sarcastic HTML Canvas game made in 2 days for the Vivatech Gamejam of March 22. We we're a group of 3 ([@tsannie](https://github.com/tsannie), [@dovdjian](https://github.com/dovdjian) and [@lafusew](https://github.com/lafusew)). 

Currently this is what we manage to achieve in 3 days.  
We would like to finish this projet to have a fun multiplayer game that you can play from time to time.

While the goal isn't to make a fully fledged game, we might take some time together to complete it. We would like to add:
- complete animations
- end game screen
- sounds & musics
- multiplayer matchmaking / room system.

## Try it yourself

### Requirements

Nodejs and Yarn.

If you're on MacOS and have Homebrew package manager installed run `brew install yarn`. It will install Nodejs which is a desktop javascript engine, and yarn which a javascript packages and dependencies manager.

If you're not on MacOS or don't have homebrew installed, first if you don't have Nodejs installed, install it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

And then install Yarn like that `curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash`

### Run the project

Run `yarn install` at the root of this directory. It will install all javascript dependencies automatically.

Run `yarn dev` and go to http://localhost:3000
